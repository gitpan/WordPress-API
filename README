WordPress::API

This distro is in development.


TESTING

If you want to test live against your blog (recommended), you should create a yaml file in t/wppost
such as:

   ---
   proxy: 'http://yoursite.com/xmlrpc.php'
   username: jorge
   password: garrapudos

This is before you run the tests.


INSTALLATION

I suggest you install from tarball by hand, not cpan- In order to test.

perl Makefile.PL
make test
make install
make realclean
